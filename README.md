# minihdl
An unambitious language for FPGA development

miniHDL is a hardware description language targeting both simulation and FPGA
synthesis. It is designed to be small and user-friendly; it sacrifices the
generality of Verilog and VHDL for a more focused approach that concentrates on
the types of hardware that are useful and interesting to its authors.
